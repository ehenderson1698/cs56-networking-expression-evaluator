#Ethan Henderson, Thomas Clifton

1. Create a program that evaluates expressions sent from a server

2. The program deos not exist yet

3. There is no software yet

4. As a user it would be nice to see the factorization printed to the screen

  *As a user, it would be nice to have a GUI interface*

5. The README.md file is empty

6. A build.xml file needs to be written

7. Yes, there are enough issues to get 1000 points. Some expectations may be slightly vague

8. We have not added any issues

9. We have no actual code. Classes we want to implement are socket and server classes, parser class, expression class using recursive algorithms

10. There are no tests. There are many opportunities to expand test coverage. We will use at least 2 tests for each method we implement.
